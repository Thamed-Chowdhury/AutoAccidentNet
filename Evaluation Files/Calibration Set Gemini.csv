2nd oil tanker fire sparks sabotage concerns,https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/accidents-fires/news/2nd-oil-tanker-fire-sparks-sabotage-concerns-3720086,6/10/2024,"The authorities concerned suspect the back-to-back fires on two oil tankers of Bangladesh Shipping Corporation (BSC) at the Chattogram port could be acts of sabotage to harm the country's energy security.

The Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC) has issued directives to ensure special cautionary measures in all depots and installations of the energy sector across the country.

The Chittagong Port Authority (CPA), Bangladesh Navy, and Bangladesh Coast Guard have also beefed up security to avert any further incidents within the port limits and also in the maritime sector.

Yesterday, a crew member died after jumping off BSC oil tanker Banglar Shourabh, which caught fire at the outer anchorage of the Chattogram port.

The deceased was identified as Sadek Mia, 59, a general steward of the vessel. He died a couple of hours after jumping off.

The incident took place just five days after three people died in a deadly explosion in another BSC oil tanker – Banglar Jyoti – on September 30.

Both the tankers were used for lightering bigger tankers anchored at the outer anchorage, and bringing crude oil to the Eastern Refinery Limited plant.

Early yesterday, Banglar Shourabh had loaded 11,055 tonnes of crude oil from Omera Legacy, a bigger tanker, and was supposed to head towards the jetty.

According to witnesses, the fire started on the ship's deck near the mid-point around 12:30am and spread fast.

Upon information, the Bangladesh Coast Guard's fire-fighting boat rushed to the spot and started work to extinguish the fire. At least six boats from the coast guard, Bangladesh Navy and CPA followed.

After the ship master called ""abandon ship"", at least 12 crew members jumped into the water. A joint rescue team rescued 36 from the vessel. The other 12 were fished out of the water by nearby fishing trawlers and the coast guard.

The fire was completely brought under control by 4:00pm.

BSC Managing Director Commodore Mahmudul Malek at a press briefing at the BSC headquarter in Chattogram said, ""Sabotage may be the top concern now as the second fire incident occurred within a short period despite strict preventative and cautionary measures taken after the first incident.""

He said the two back-to-back incidents might be acts of sabotage to harm the country's energy security.

Quoting crew members, Mahmudul said they first noticed sequential ignitions at four points on the ship, which is ""very unlikely to happen"".

He said they also noticed a speedboat passing by at the time.

The BSC MD further said that following the explosion on Banglar Jyoti and amid criticisms of using two old ships for lightering, preventative measures were taken over the last few days, including carrying out daily fire drills, checking the ventilation system and looking out for any leakage on the Banglar Shourabh to avert a repeat incident.

He added that there was no physical activity going on on the ship when the fire began.

Mahmudul said both the ships were supposed to be phased out after Banglar Shourabh's last trip yesterday, adding that they were working to hire a foreign oil tanker for lightering.

Senior officials of the CPA, the navy and coast guard were present at the briefing.

CPA Member M Fazlar Rahman said an order was issued to strictly follow the port's security system at the jetties as well as within the port limits till Matarbari.

The navy and coast guard, who are dedicated to maintaining the security at the outer anchorage and port limits, have been requested to enhance round-the-clock patrols.

Contacted, BPC Managing Director Amin Ul Ahsan said consecutive fire incidents on two tankers was not a ""mere accident"".

""It could be sabotage"".

He said directives were given to ensure special cautionary measures in all depots and installations of the energy sector across the country.

Following the fire incidents, the BPC authorities are now actively trying to launch a single point mooring (SPM) with a double pipeline project, which will enable the discharging of imported crude oil through underwater pipelines.

The commercial operations of the SPM project have not yet started, despite trial operations three months ago.

Amin Ul Hasan said the operator appointment process for the SPM project, located in the middle of the sea, is currently ongoing.

He said the energy ministry has also asked for the completion of the process as soon as possible.

""We're trying to start commercial operations of the SPM at the earliest. Safety will be ensured to a large extent if oil is transported through SPM.""

Meanwhile, the BSC formed an eight-member probe committee, led by its Executive Director Engineer Mohammad Yousuf, to investigate the fire incident and were asked to submit a report within five days.

The shipping ministry and department of shipping formed two separate committees in this regard as well.",General,General

Fire ignited on ship in a highly suspicious way,https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/accidents-fires/news/fire-ignited-ship-highly-suspicious-way-3720456,5/10/2024,"Banglar Shourabh chief engineer narrates how the fire ignited and how it spread

Banglar Shourabh Chief Engineer Rashedul Hasan was going through the checklist of engine equipment in his cabin when he heard a loud sound on the deck.

From the C-deck, which houses the cabins of the top four officials including the captain and chief engineer, the overview of the whole ship can be seen.

""It was around 12:15am. I could see fire igniting at four nearby points on the deck near the mid-ship point. The fire ignited in a Z-shape and spread fast,"" Rashed told The Daily Star while talking about the BSC oil tanker which caught fire early today.

He said it was very unusual that ignitions occurred sequentially from the portside on the left to the starboard side on the right, and then back to portside and starboard.

Rashedul said one of the crewmen noticed a speedboat passed their ship a few minutes before the fire ignited.

The incident occurred after the ship completed lightering 11,055 tonnes of crude oil from a bigger oil tanker at the outer anchorage of Chittagong port and was supposed to sail for the port jetty this morning.

Rashidul said he Immediately went to the bridge room, informed Bangladesh Shipping Corporation officials and called the Coast Guard, navy and port authority for help.

He then rushed to the engine room on the ground floor, disconnected the power supply to the deck and other parts of the ship except the accommodation rooms, and minimised operation of different equipment.

As the fire spread, the captain decided to abandon the ship.

At first, the crew boarded a fishing trawler and later shifted to a Coast Guard tugboat which came for their rescue.

Some crewmen, however, jumped into the sea to save their lives and were later rescued.

Hasan, a 47th batch student of Bangladesh Marine Academy, joined the mariner's job in 2012. He joined Banglar Shourobh four months ago after working in Banglar Jyoti which was also damaged in a deadly explosion on Monday.

""I never saw such a dangerous incident in my career,"" said the young chief engineer who was injured in the left arm.

He expressed relief since the fire did not reach any of the eight oil tanks of the ship.

""If that had happened and the tanks exploded, none of us on board would have survived,"" he said.

""It would have been a catastrophe as nearby ships at the outer anchorage would have caught fire as well,"" he said.",General,General

The victims were identified as deck cadet Shourabh Kumar Saha, foreman Nurul Islam, and casual staff Md Harun.

The ""Banglar Jyoti"", owned by the national flag carrier Bangladesh Shipping Corporation (BSC), was unloading crude oil when the explosion took place at the forecastle, the forward part, of the ship at around 11:00am.

The explosion, which later resulted in a fire, severely damaged the ship's forecastle.

The vessel berthed at Dolphin Jetty No. 7 at 10:00am after bringing 11,700 tonnes of crude oil from a larger oil tanker, MT Omera Legacy, anchored at the outer anchorage.

Chittagong Port Authority (CPA) Secretary Md Omar Faruk said the crude oil was imported for Eastern Refinery Limited.

""Following the explosion, fireboats from the Bangladesh Navy, Chittagong Port Authority, and Coast Guard and several units from Fire Service and Civil Defence rushed to the spot and managed to bring the fire under control by 12:30pm.""

""As a precautionary measure, all nearby ships were relocated to safe zones, and oil installations were instructed to remain on high alert.""

BSC Managing Director Commodore Mahmudul Malek, at a press conference in the afternoon, said the deck cadet and the two staffers were carrying out routine maintenance at the ship's forecastle when crude oil was being unloaded.

""The maintenance did not include any fire-related work, which could have triggered the explosion.""

Malek said an investigation into the incident would reveal the cause of the explosion and the extent of damage.

As such, the ship's lifecycle had ended in 2012.

9 killed as microbus carrying wedding party falls into canal in Barguna,https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/nation/349937/7-killed-as-microbus-carrying-wedding-party-falls,22-06-2024,"Nine people including three children were killed in a road accident after a microbus carrying a wedding party plunged into a canal after a bridge collapsed in Amtali, Barguna on Saturday.

The accident took place on a Haldiya bridge connecting Naura and Haldiya Bazar around 2pm, said Amtali police station Officer-in-Charge (OC) Shakhawat Hossain Tipu.

The tragic end of those people left the whole area in mourning, with the cries of the bereaved filling the air.

The bride’s family members and relatives were traveling in a microbus and an auto-rickshaw to the groom’s house around 1:30pm. As the vehicles crossed the Haldiya Bridge, the central portion of the bridge collapsed, causing the vehicles to plunge into the river. The passengers in the auto-rickshaw managed to swim to safety, but those in the microbus drowned, said the OC.

A total of nine bodies, including six women and three children, have been recovered, said the police official.

The victims were relatives of the bride.

The deceased are Rubia, 45, Raiti, 22, Fatema, 55, Rukaiyat Islam, 4, Tahiya Mehjabin Azad, 7, Tasfia, 14, Hridi, 4 and Ruby Begum, 35, of Madaripur's Shibchar upazila and Jakia Begum, 35 and her daughter Hridi of Amtali upazila's Haldia village.

The police, fire service, and residents carried out the rescue operations.

Asaduzzaman, chairman of the Haldia Union Parishad, said that the vehicle carrying mostly women and children sank in the canal while crossing a dilapidated bridge.

Eyewitnesses said that as soon as the microbus and auto-rickshaw reached the middle of the bridge, it collapsed with a thud, causing the vehicles to fall into the river.

They immediately tried to rescue the victims with the help of locals.

Later, the fire service and police joined the rescue operation.

Local residents reported that the bridge was quite old and had not been repaired for a long time.

Abul Kalam Azad, husband of a deceased, said: “I have lost everything. My two daughters and wife are dead. I am now helpless.”

Sohail Mia, who was in the microbus, said: “There were 16 passengers in the microbus heading to the groom’s house. As soon as we got on the Haldiya Hat Bridge, it collapsed, and the microbus fell into the river. Three of us managed to swim to safety. Later, locals, the fire service, and the police recovered nine bodies.”

The bodies were taken to Amtali Upazila Health Complex.

Following the incident, thousands of people protested, demanding justice for the victims and punishment for the contractor, one Shahidul Islam Mridha, who constructed the bridge around 10 years back.

Hearing the incident, local lawmaker Golam Sarwar Tuku, Deputy Commissioner Md Rafiqul Islam, Upazila Parishad Chairman Alhaj Golam Sarwar Forkan and others rushed to the spot.

Lawmaker Tuku said: “I have expressed condolences to the victims’ families at the hospital and visited the site. I have also calmed the agitated people at the site. If irregularities in the bridge construction led to this incident, an investigation will be conducted, and legal action will be taken. Financial assistance will be provided to the victims’ families.”

Deputy Commissioner Md Rafiqul Islam said he has visited the site. Legal action will be taken against the contractor for irregularities in the bridge construction.”

The bodies were handed over to the families without autopsies upon appeals from the victims’ families, said the OC.

Amtali Fire Service In-Charge Md Hanif said despite four hours of efforts they could not recover the microbus. The rescue operation was still going on.

There are allegations that contractor Mridha built the bridge poorly. As a result, the central beam of the bridge broke within five years of its construction. For the past ten years, around 50,000 people from Haldiya Union, Chawra, and nearby areas have been using the weakened bridge.

It was learned that in the fiscal year 2008-09, the iron bridge over the Chawra River at Haldiya Hat, was built at a cost of approximately Tk2 crore.

The construction contract was awarded to Mridha, the then-chairman of Haldiya Union Parishad and president of the local Awami League.

Denying the allegation, contractor Mridha claimed: “I constructed the bridge properly. There were no irregularities in the construction.”

Amtali Upazila Engineer Abdullah Al Mamun said: “The bridge was constructed before I joined Amtali. I have no knowledge about it.”",Specific,"Specific<sep>22 Jun 2024, 04:30 PM<sep>22 Jun 2024<sep>2pm<sep>9<sep>0<sep>Haldiya bridge connecting Naura and Haldiya Bazar, Amtali<sep>Bridge<sep>No<sep>microbus-auto-rickshaw<sep>Barguna"
Why did safety measures fail to stem road accidents during Eid?,https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/350445/why-did-safety-measures-fail-to-stem-road,28-06-2024,"Despite various safety measures taken by law enforcement, the number of road accidents and fatalities increased during this year’s Eid-ul-Azha trips compared to last year, raising questions about their effectiveness.

Almost every day, reports of road accidents come from various parts of the country. Especially during the two Eids each year, millions of people travel to different destinations, significantly increasing the number of vehicles on the roads and, consequently, road accidents.

This year the police took different initiatives to reduce the number of accidents and bring order to the highways before Eid-ul-Azha: speed guns were installed on the highways, temporary help camps and thousands of checkpoints were set up at entry points to make the journey safe and comfortable.

Nonetheless, the number of road crashes increased this year.

Transport sector experts say merely improving road infrastructure will not suffice; the government must also implement strategic transport planning. Without this, road discipline cannot be achieved.

According to the Bangladesh Jatri Kalyan Samity, a passenger welfare association, in the 15 days before and after this year’s Eid-ul-Azha, there were 309 road accidents across the country's roads and highways, resulting in 458 fatalities and 1,840 injuries.

Its data from last year's Eid-ul-Azha shows that during the 15-day period from June 22 to July 6, there were 277 road accidents, resulting in 299 deaths and 544 injuries. So this year’s Eid-ul-Azha saw a 53.17% increase in fatalities and a 238.23% increase in injuries.

Bangladesh Jatri Kalyan Samity Secretary General Mozammel Haque Chowdhury said millions of vehicles were added to the roads every year, especially small ones, leading to an increase in accidents.

“The government is indifferent to implementing strategic transport plans. Even though the new Road Transport Act has been enacted, why are road accidents not decreasing?

“An official audit is necessary. There is no research on road safety. The actual culprits of road accidents are not being identified. No engineer is being held accountable for road defects. Due to weak investigations and lengthy legal processes, victims of road accidents are deprived of legal protection. Despite the government's goodwill, road accidents are not decreasing,” he added.

What does Police Headquarters say?

The Police Headquarters said this year’s Eid journey had been safe and comfortable due to the multifaceted measures taken by the police, including the use of speed guns on highways.

From June 13 to 18, the police used speed guns at 556 locations on various highways and roads. During the same period, there were 1,458 prosecutions for speeding.

It further stated that due to the measures for Eid-ul-Azha, traffic had been normal and people's Eid journeys had been safe and comfortable.

Generally, speeding is considered one of the main causes of road accidents.

By preventing unauthorized vehicles from transporting passengers and controlling vehicle speeds through the use of speed guns, road accidents had been reduced, the Police Headquarters claimed.
• Eid Holidays: BJKS-BRTA at loggerheads over number of road accident victims

It added that legal actions were taken against 583 vehicles for transporting passengers in non-public transport from June 13 to 18.

Additionally, the police said it had taken measures against various types of vehicles through 2,014 checkpoints, and there had been 7,102 prosecutions during the period.

The Police Headquarters mentioned that these activities would continue to ensure safe and comfortable travel for the public.

Highway Police Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Mahfuzur Rahman said there were 22,000 kilometres of roads and highways across the country, with the Highway Police being responsible for only 3,000 kilometres.

“The remaining roads are secured by district and station police. The Highway Police has a limited workforce. Many of our 2,900 personnel are engaged in office work and do not go to the field. It is not possible to provide complete security with such a small number of people. Given our limitations, we monitor roads and highways using technology and CCTV cameras to ensure smooth travel for passengers,” the senior police officer added.

“During Eid, about 15 million people move from one place to another. Usually, 100,000 vehicles use the highways daily, increasing to 170,000 to 190,000 during Eid.

“Additionally, as the population increases, so does the number of vehicles. The existing workforce is too small to manage these vehicles effectively. We are discussing with the relevant government departments how to solve these problems,” he continued.

Kazi Md Shifun Newaz, assistant professor at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology’s Accident Research Institute, said several issues needed to be addressed to bring order to the roads and reduce accidents. “The government must fully implement the speed limits it has set; speed cameras need to be installed on roads; safety must be ensured; faulty roads should be repaired; and defective vehicles should be discarded.”

On the same topic, Road Safety Foundation Executive Director Saidur Rahman said although the government was improving road infrastructure, it had not given much attention to the salaries, benefits and working hours of drivers and their assistants.

“Everything needs to be brought under a specific policy. All types of extortion on roads and highways must be completely stopped.”

He also called for weeding out unskilled drivers and unfit vehicles, demanding putting an end to the transportation of excess passengers.",General,General

"Road accidents: 320 killed in a year on Dhaka-Khulna, Barisal highways",https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/nation/344408/road-accidents-320-killed-in-a-year-on,20-04-2024,"Roads in Bangladesh have become more dangerous, with fatalities and injuries almost every day, and the two highways from Dhaka to Khulna and Barisal are two of those that have witnessed 320 fatalities in the past year.

Unskilled drivers, over-speed, negligence of authorities concerned and rules violation are blamed for the frequent road accidents on highways, although the highway police claimed that several measures have been taken to reduce road accidents.

The recent deadly road crash on Dhaka-Khulna highway that claimed 15 lives raised questions about whether these measures were adequate to control the fatal accidents.

On April 16, 15 people including five members of a family, died in a collision between a bus and a pick-up van on Dhaka-Khulna highway at Kanaipur, Faridpur district.

A five-member probe body was formed to investigate the accident and two more members, including an expert from Buet, were also included in the committee, headed by Additional district Magistrate Ali Siddique.

The committee was asked to submit its report within three working days. At least one representative from the Roads and Highways division, Highway police, district police and Fire Service were also included in the committee.

National Committee to protect Shipping, Roads and Railways (NCPSRR) said the authorities concerned, including police and BRTA, cannot avoid responsibility for the Faridpur road crash on Dhaka-Khulna highway.

Condemning the authorities’ negligence, the NCPSRR said although carrying passengers on trucks, pick-up vans and good- laden vehicles is prohibited the vehicle was heading towards Dhaka from Faridpur’s Boalmari with 25-30 passengers on board.

On March 8, three people died and ten others were injured when a bus overturned on Dhaka-Barisal highway in Bhanga.

Besides, nine people died in separate accidents in January.

Roads and Highways division and highway police blame over-speed, unskilled drivers, reckless plying of motorbikes and pedestrians’ desperate bid to cross the highways behind the accidents and fatalities.

According to Faridpur Highway Police sources, the length of the Bangabandhu Expressway from Jatrabari in Dhaka to Bhanga in Faridpur is 55 kilometers. Of these, 32 kilometers are from Jatrabari to Padma Bridge and 23 kilometers from Janjira to Bhanga.

In the last year, 131 people were killed in 135 accidents on the expressway, and of these, 63 accidents occurred in Bhanga portion that claimed the lives of 67 people.

There are five highway police stations, one police outpost, and two camps under the 381 km highway in Madaripur region.

Shahinur Alam Khan, superintendent of Madaripur Region highway police, said a number of measures have been taken to prevent road crashes.

In the past one year, 28,404 cases were filed, and Tk9.43 crore was fined for reckless driving on the two highways, said the SP.

Besides, 271 cases were filed in 432 road accidents on the Dhaka-Khulna and Dhaka-Barisal highways, he said.

Morshed Alam, superintendent of Faridpur police, said the owners and transport workers must play a big role alongside the passengers to stop accidents on highways.

Besides, the residents along the highways have to be more responsible while using highways, he said.",General,General

Ensuring road safety should never take a backseat,https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/editorial/344172/ensuring-road-safety-should-never-take-a-backseat,17-04-2024,"It is unfortunate how the Eid holidays in Bangladesh have once again highlighted the pressing issue of road safety in the country; according to a report by Dhaka Tribune, road crashes claimed the lives of 34 individuals during this period.

To say that there is an urgent need for enhanced safety measures would be an understatement, but with this spike in deaths during holidays becoming a most undesirable norm, safety measures are particularly salient during major holidays.

Bangladesh has long been struggling with a high rate of road traffic accidents, with holidays often exacerbating the situation. Factors such as reckless driving, inadequate road infrastructure, and lax enforcement of traffic laws have further compounded the risks faced by commuters as well as pedestrians during these times.

Immediate action is the need of the hour, from both the government and the public. It starts with the government truly prioritizing road safety. Investing in better infrastructure is the logical first step, including the expansion and improvement of road networks. Too often, it is our inadequate roads and highways that cause the issues.

With that said, arguably the worst offense continues to be the presence of unfit vehicles on the road combined with unfit drivers, those without licenses and proper training. It is mind boggling how, despite repeated calls to address and fix the issue, this continues to not only persist but arguably worsen with time. Stricter enforcement of traffic laws and harsh penalties for offenders are essential to deter reckless driving behaviours, and it is disheartening how we fail to ensure this time and time again.

The recent spate of road crashes during the Eid holidays serves as a stark reminder of the urgent need for enhanced road safety measures in Bangladesh. There can be no Smart Bangladesh if our people keep dying on the roads.",General,General
