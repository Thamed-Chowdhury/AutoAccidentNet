These findings were disclosed during a press conference titled ""Student Fatalities in Road Accidents: Statistics and Analysis"" held at the RSF office in Dhaka on Saturday, marking the anniversary of the Mirsharai tragedy.

During this period, students comprised 16.29% of all road accident fatalities, with a total of 34,478 deaths reported.

The press conference underscored the urgent need for measures to enhance road safety due to the high number of student deaths.
• Our road accident prevention is spinning out

Mirsharai Tragedy Day is locally observed in memory of the 45 people, including 42 students, who died when a pickup truck carrying them overturned into a pond beside the road in Chittagong's Mirsharai on July 11, 2011.

The students were returning from the Bangabandhu-Bangamata Gold Cup football tournament at Mirsharai Stadium.

The report highlighted that 2,641 victims, aged between 5 and 17, were from schools and madrasas, representing 47% of the total student fatalities. Meanwhile, 2,978 victims, aged between 18 and 25, were from colleges and universities, making up 53%.

Additionally, the report revealed that around 833 students lost their lives over the past five and a half years due to carelessly crossing railway tracks and walking along rail lines while wearing headphones.

""Numerous major accidents have occurred since the tragic incident in Mirsharai. However, no long-term sustainable plan has been implemented to establish discipline in the road transport sector. The initiatives being taken are largely unscientific and uncoordinated,"" said Dr AI Mahbub Uddin Ahmed, RSF chairman and professor at the Department of Sociology at Dhaka University.

""To establish order in the chaotic road transport sector, a long-term, integrated sustainable transport strategy must be implemented,"" he added.

During the press conference, the RSF identified several reasons for student fatalities in road accidents, including faulty roads and unsafe vehicles, a lack of knowledge about safe road usage, and a tendency among students to ride motorcycles recklessly.

To prevent such accidents, the RSF made several recommendations, including prohibiting underage individuals from riding motorcycles, strictly enforcing road safety laws, organizing road safety campaigns in educational institutions, government initiatives to train teachers on road safety, introducing road safety topics in exams, banning unsafe vehicles, ensuring safety measures on roads near educational institutions, and raising public awareness about road safety.

The RSF also called for the national observance of ""Mirsharai Tragedy Day.""

They believe that recognizing this day on a national level will raise awareness about road safety among students through activities at educational institutions and express sympathy to the families of the deceased students.",General,General

"Quader blames motorcycles, easy bikes for increasing road accidents",https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/349685/quader-blames-motorcycles-easy-bikes-for,19-06-2024,"Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader on Wednesday said that motorcycles and easy bikes are the leading causes of road accidents across Bangladesh.

Quader made these remarks during an Eid greetings exchange at his ministry's conference room in the Secretariat at 11:30am.

""It is very unfortunate that lately, motorcycle accidents have become more frequent. Looking at the accident data, motorcycles account for the highest number of accidents, followed by easy bikes. Reckless driving also plays a significant role. We can not ignore this. I urge the ssecretary to expedite the formulation of a policy,"" he said.

The minister further said that the lack of regulation for millions of three-wheelers and motorcycles is disrupting order on the roads, highlighting the urgent need for a policy.

""People's lives should come before livelihoods. In trying to protect livelihoods, lives are being put at risk. Those involved in electoral politics often support or endorse this. Easy bikes on highways receive a lot of support, sometimes even encouragement from behind the scenes. In Dhaka, our current regulations ensure that 98% of riders have helmets,"" the minister said.

Quader also said that while the Eid journeys on roads have been relatively smooth, the return trips remain a concern. ""The return journeys often receive less attention, which can lead to accidents. Therefore, we must focus on ensuring the safety of the return journeys as well.""

"Energy Division enforcing ‘no helmet, no fuel’ directive amid rising motorcycle accidents",https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/349120/energy-division-enforcing-%E2%80%98no-helmet-no-fuel%E2%80%99,12/6/2024,"The Road Transport and Highways Division issued a “no helmet, no fuel” directive last month, stating that motorcycle riders not wearing helmets will be denied fuel at filling stations. Now the Energy and Mineral Resources Division is taking measures to ensure compliance with this rule.

The move aims to ensure safety amid an increase in motorcycle-related road accidents in the country.

Many people travel to their villages or hometowns on motorbikes for Eid. Notably, each year during both the outbound and return trips related to the two Eids, these vehicles are frequently involved in road accidents.

In Dhaka, motorcyclists wear helmets due to strict enforcement by traffic police. However, on regional roads or highways, helmet use is rare. If there is a passenger, even if the rider wears a helmet, the passenger behind him in most cases does not.

Motorcycles serve as a popular mode of quick transportation nationwide, but they are also prone to accidents. Many young individuals rely on these two-wheelers, with a significant increase in motorcycle use in and outside the capital in recent years.

During the last Eid-ul-Fitr, motorcycles ranked highest among vehicles involved in road crashes, according to data from the Bangladesh Jatri Kalyan Samity, a passenger welfare association. One hundred sixty-five people died and 240 sustained injuries in 198 motorcycle accidents during Eid travel, accounting for 49.62% of the total number of road accidents, 40.54% of fatalities and 30.37% of injuries during the period.

A letter dated June 5, signed by the deputy secretary of the energy division, contains instructions regarding the ""no helmet, no fuel"" directive issued by the Road Transport and Highways Division on May 20. The directive applies to motorcyclists and passengers under Section 124 of the Road Transport Act. The letter stresses that motorcycle riders and refuelling station owners must adhere to these instructions, or else legal action will be taken against them in accordance with the law.

The letter also instructs oil companies and filling station owners to take measures accordingly.

An energy division official, on condition of anonymity, said the directive was not being followed outside Dhaka, adding that the authorities were looking into the matter.

With the increasing use of motorcycles, even in rural areas, the energy division was enforcing strict measures keeping in mind the safety of the general public, the official said.

The official emphasized that people would no longer be allowed to purchase fuel if they did not use helmets.",General,General
