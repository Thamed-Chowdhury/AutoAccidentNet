2nd oil tanker fire sparks sabotage concerns,https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/accidents-fires/news/2nd-oil-tanker-fire-sparks-sabotage-concerns-3720086,6/10/2024,"The authorities concerned suspect the back-to-back fires on two oil tankers of Bangladesh Shipping Corporation (BSC) at the Chattogram port could be acts of sabotage to harm the country's energy security.

The Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC) has issued directives to ensure special cautionary measures in all depots and installations of the energy sector across the country.

The Chittagong Port Authority (CPA), Bangladesh Navy, and Bangladesh Coast Guard have also beefed up security to avert any further incidents within the port limits and also in the maritime sector.

Yesterday, a crew member died after jumping off BSC oil tanker Banglar Shourabh, which caught fire at the outer anchorage of the Chattogram port.

The deceased was identified as Sadek Mia, 59, a general steward of the vessel. He died a couple of hours after jumping off.

The incident took place just five days after three people died in a deadly explosion in another BSC oil tanker – Banglar Jyoti – on September 30.

Both the tankers were used for lightering bigger tankers anchored at the outer anchorage, and bringing crude oil to the Eastern Refinery Limited plant.

Early yesterday, Banglar Shourabh had loaded 11,055 tonnes of crude oil from Omera Legacy, a bigger tanker, and was supposed to head towards the jetty.

According to witnesses, the fire started on the ship's deck near the mid-point around 12:30am and spread fast.

Upon information, the Bangladesh Coast Guard's fire-fighting boat rushed to the spot and started work to extinguish the fire. At least six boats from the coast guard, Bangladesh Navy and CPA followed.

After the ship master called ""abandon ship"", at least 12 crew members jumped into the water. A joint rescue team rescued 36 from the vessel. The other 12 were fished out of the water by nearby fishing trawlers and the coast guard.

The fire was completely brought under control by 4:00pm.

BSC Managing Director Commodore Mahmudul Malek at a press briefing at the BSC headquarter in Chattogram said, ""Sabotage may be the top concern now as the second fire incident occurred within a short period despite strict preventative and cautionary measures taken after the first incident.""

He said the two back-to-back incidents might be acts of sabotage to harm the country's energy security.

Quoting crew members, Mahmudul said they first noticed sequential ignitions at four points on the ship, which is ""very unlikely to happen"".

He said they also noticed a speedboat passing by at the time.

The BSC MD further said that following the explosion on Banglar Jyoti and amid criticisms of using two old ships for lightering, preventative measures were taken over the last few days, including carrying out daily fire drills, checking the ventilation system and looking out for any leakage on the Banglar Shourabh to avert a repeat incident.

He added that there was no physical activity going on on the ship when the fire began.

Mahmudul said both the ships were supposed to be phased out after Banglar Shourabh's last trip yesterday, adding that they were working to hire a foreign oil tanker for lightering.

Senior officials of the CPA, the navy and coast guard were present at the briefing.

CPA Member M Fazlar Rahman said an order was issued to strictly follow the port's security system at the jetties as well as within the port limits till Matarbari.

The navy and coast guard, who are dedicated to maintaining the security at the outer anchorage and port limits, have been requested to enhance round-the-clock patrols.

Contacted, BPC Managing Director Amin Ul Ahsan said consecutive fire incidents on two tankers was not a ""mere accident"".

""It could be sabotage"".

He said directives were given to ensure special cautionary measures in all depots and installations of the energy sector across the country.

Following the fire incidents, the BPC authorities are now actively trying to launch a single point mooring (SPM) with a double pipeline project, which will enable the discharging of imported crude oil through underwater pipelines.

The commercial operations of the SPM project have not yet started, despite trial operations three months ago.

Amin Ul Hasan said the operator appointment process for the SPM project, located in the middle of the sea, is currently ongoing.

He said the energy ministry has also asked for the completion of the process as soon as possible.

""We're trying to start commercial operations of the SPM at the earliest. Safety will be ensured to a large extent if oil is transported through SPM.""

Meanwhile, the BSC formed an eight-member probe committee, led by its Executive Director Engineer Mohammad Yousuf, to investigate the fire incident and were asked to submit a report within five days.

The shipping ministry and department of shipping formed two separate committees in this regard as well.",General,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable

Banglar Shourabh Chief Engineer Rashedul Hasan was going through the checklist of engine equipment in his cabin when he heard a loud sound on the deck.

From the C-deck, which houses the cabins of the top four officials including the captain and chief engineer, the overview of the whole ship can be seen.

""It was around 12:15am. I could see fire igniting at four nearby points on the deck near the mid-ship point. The fire ignited in a Z-shape and spread fast,"" Rashed told The Daily Star while talking about the BSC oil tanker which caught fire early today.

He said it was very unusual that ignitions occurred sequentially from the portside on the left to the starboard side on the right, and then back to portside and starboard.

Rashedul said one of the crewmen noticed a speedboat passed their ship a few minutes before the fire ignited.

The incident occurred after the ship completed lightering 11,055 tonnes of crude oil from a bigger oil tanker at the outer anchorage of Chittagong port and was supposed to sail for the port jetty this morning.

Rashidul said he Immediately went to the bridge room, informed Bangladesh Shipping Corporation officials and called the Coast Guard, navy and port authority for help.

He then rushed to the engine room on the ground floor, disconnected the power supply to the deck and other parts of the ship except the accommodation rooms, and minimised operation of different equipment.

As the fire spread, the captain decided to abandon the ship.

At first, the crew boarded a fishing trawler and later shifted to a Coast Guard tugboat which came for their rescue.

Some crewmen, however, jumped into the sea to save their lives and were later rescued.

Hasan, a 47th batch student of Bangladesh Marine Academy, joined the mariner's job in 2012. He joined Banglar Shourobh four months ago after working in Banglar Jyoti which was also damaged in a deadly explosion on Monday.

""I never saw such a dangerous incident in my career,"" said the young chief engineer who was injured in the left arm.

He expressed relief since the fire did not reach any of the eight oil tanks of the ship.

""If that had happened and the tanks exploded, none of us on board would have survived,"" he said.

""It would have been a catastrophe as nearby ships at the outer anchorage would have caught fire as well,"" he said.",General,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable

Chittagong Port Authority (CPA) Secretary Md Omar Faruk said the crude oil was imported for Eastern Refinery Limited.

""Following the explosion, fireboats from the Bangladesh Navy, Chittagong Port Authority, and Coast Guard and several units from Fire Service and Civil Defence rushed to the spot and managed to bring the fire under control by 12:30pm.""

""As a precautionary measure, all nearby ships were relocated to safe zones, and oil installations were instructed to remain on high alert.""

BSC Managing Director Commodore Mahmudul Malek, at a press conference in the afternoon, said the deck cadet and the two staffers were carrying out routine maintenance at the ship's forecastle when crude oil was being unloaded.

""The maintenance did not include any fire-related work, which could have triggered the explosion.""

Malek said an investigation into the incident would reveal the cause of the explosion and the extent of damage.

The ship was bought by the Bangladesh Shipping Corporation in 1987, when it had a lifespan of 25 years.

As such, the ship's lifecycle had ended in 2012.

Regarding this, Malek said the ship had been operated through intensive regular maintenance since it was contributing economically.

He went on to say that the explosion was not the result of a mechanical failure because it did not come from the engine or generator.

Meanwhile, the BSC formed two probe bodies, one for investigating the incident and the other to properly compensate the victims' families.

The Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC) also formed a seven-member probe committee led by Managing Director Sharif Hasnat of the Eastern Refinery Limited to investigate the explosion.

BPC Director Anupam Barua said the committee was directed to submit a report within a day.",General,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable

These findings were disclosed during a press conference titled ""Student Fatalities in Road Accidents: Statistics and Analysis"" held at the RSF office in Dhaka on Saturday, marking the anniversary of the Mirsharai tragedy.

During this period, students comprised 16.29% of all road accident fatalities, with a total of 34,478 deaths reported.

The press conference underscored the urgent need for measures to enhance road safety due to the high number of student deaths.
• Our road accident prevention is spinning out

Mirsharai Tragedy Day is locally observed in memory of the 45 people, including 42 students, who died when a pickup truck carrying them overturned into a pond beside the road in Chittagong's Mirsharai on July 11, 2011.

The students were returning from the Bangabandhu-Bangamata Gold Cup football tournament at Mirsharai Stadium.

The report highlighted that 2,641 victims, aged between 5 and 17, were from schools and madrasas, representing 47% of the total student fatalities. Meanwhile, 2,978 victims, aged between 18 and 25, were from colleges and universities, making up 53%.

Additionally, the report revealed that around 833 students lost their lives over the past five and a half years due to carelessly crossing railway tracks and walking along rail lines while wearing headphones.

""Numerous major accidents have occurred since the tragic incident in Mirsharai. However, no long-term sustainable plan has been implemented to establish discipline in the road transport sector. The initiatives being taken are largely unscientific and uncoordinated,"" said Dr AI Mahbub Uddin Ahmed, RSF chairman and professor at the Department of Sociology at Dhaka University.

""To establish order in the chaotic road transport sector, a long-term, integrated sustainable transport strategy must be implemented,"" he added.

During the press conference, the RSF identified several reasons for student fatalities in road accidents, including faulty roads and unsafe vehicles, a lack of knowledge about safe road usage, and a tendency among students to ride motorcycles recklessly.

To prevent such accidents, the RSF made several recommendations, including prohibiting underage individuals from riding motorcycles, strictly enforcing road safety laws, organizing road safety campaigns in educational institutions, government initiatives to train teachers on road safety, introducing road safety topics in exams, banning unsafe vehicles, ensuring safety measures on roads near educational institutions, and raising public awareness about road safety.

The RSF also called for the national observance of ""Mirsharai Tragedy Day.""

They believe that recognizing this day on a national level will raise awareness about road safety among students through activities at educational institutions and express sympathy to the families of the deceased students.",General,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable

Why did safety measures fail to stem road accidents during Eid?,https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/350445/why-did-safety-measures-fail-to-stem-road,28-06-2024,"Despite various safety measures taken by law enforcement, the number of road accidents and fatalities increased during this year’s Eid-ul-Azha trips compared to last year, raising questions about their effectiveness.

Almost every day, reports of road accidents come from various parts of the country. Especially during the two Eids each year, millions of people travel to different destinations, significantly increasing the number of vehicles on the roads and, consequently, road accidents.

This year the police took different initiatives to reduce the number of accidents and bring order to the highways before Eid-ul-Azha: speed guns were installed on the highways, temporary help camps and thousands of checkpoints were set up at entry points to make the journey safe and comfortable.

Nonetheless, the number of road crashes increased this year.

Transport sector experts say merely improving road infrastructure will not suffice; the government must also implement strategic transport planning. Without this, road discipline cannot be achieved.

According to the Bangladesh Jatri Kalyan Samity, a passenger welfare association, in the 15 days before and after this year’s Eid-ul-Azha, there were 309 road accidents across the country's roads and highways, resulting in 458 fatalities and 1,840 injuries.

Its data from last year's Eid-ul-Azha shows that during the 15-day period from June 22 to July 6, there were 277 road accidents, resulting in 299 deaths and 544 injuries. So this year’s Eid-ul-Azha saw a 53.17% increase in fatalities and a 238.23% increase in injuries.

Bangladesh Jatri Kalyan Samity Secretary General Mozammel Haque Chowdhury said millions of vehicles were added to the roads every year, especially small ones, leading to an increase in accidents.

“The government is indifferent to implementing strategic transport plans. Even though the new Road Transport Act has been enacted, why are road accidents not decreasing?

“An official audit is necessary. There is no research on road safety. The actual culprits of road accidents are not being identified. No engineer is being held accountable for road defects. Due to weak investigations and lengthy legal processes, victims of road accidents are deprived of legal protection. Despite the government's goodwill, road accidents are not decreasing,” he added.

What does Police Headquarters say?

The Police Headquarters said this year’s Eid journey had been safe and comfortable due to the multifaceted measures taken by the police, including the use of speed guns on highways.

From June 13 to 18, the police used speed guns at 556 locations on various highways and roads. During the same period, there were 1,458 prosecutions for speeding.

It further stated that due to the measures for Eid-ul-Azha, traffic had been normal and people's Eid journeys had been safe and comfortable.

Generally, speeding is considered one of the main causes of road accidents.

By preventing unauthorized vehicles from transporting passengers and controlling vehicle speeds through the use of speed guns, road accidents had been reduced, the Police Headquarters claimed.
• Eid Holidays: BJKS-BRTA at loggerheads over number of road accident victims

It added that legal actions were taken against 583 vehicles for transporting passengers in non-public transport from June 13 to 18.

Additionally, the police said it had taken measures against various types of vehicles through 2,014 checkpoints, and there had been 7,102 prosecutions during the period.

The Police Headquarters mentioned that these activities would continue to ensure safe and comfortable travel for the public.

Highway Police Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Mahfuzur Rahman said there were 22,000 kilometres of roads and highways across the country, with the Highway Police being responsible for only 3,000 kilometres.

“The remaining roads are secured by district and station police. The Highway Police has a limited workforce. Many of our 2,900 personnel are engaged in office work and do not go to the field. It is not possible to provide complete security with such a small number of people. Given our limitations, we monitor roads and highways using technology and CCTV cameras to ensure smooth travel for passengers,” the senior police officer added.

“During Eid, about 15 million people move from one place to another. Usually, 100,000 vehicles use the highways daily, increasing to 170,000 to 190,000 during Eid.

“Additionally, as the population increases, so does the number of vehicles. The existing workforce is too small to manage these vehicles effectively. We are discussing with the relevant government departments how to solve these problems,” he continued.

Kazi Md Shifun Newaz, assistant professor at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology’s Accident Research Institute, said several issues needed to be addressed to bring order to the roads and reduce accidents. “The government must fully implement the speed limits it has set; speed cameras need to be installed on roads; safety must be ensured; faulty roads should be repaired; and defective vehicles should be discarded.”

On the same topic, Road Safety Foundation Executive Director Saidur Rahman said although the government was improving road infrastructure, it had not given much attention to the salaries, benefits and working hours of drivers and their assistants.

“Everything needs to be brought under a specific policy. All types of extortion on roads and highways must be completely stopped.”

He also called for weeding out unskilled drivers and unfit vehicles, demanding putting an end to the transportation of excess passengers.",General,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable

In Dhaka, motorcyclists wear helmets due to strict enforcement by traffic police. However, on regional roads or highways, helmet use is rare. If there is a passenger, even if the rider wears a helmet, the passenger behind him in most cases does not.

Motorcycles serve as a popular mode of quick transportation nationwide, but they are also prone to accidents. Many young individuals rely on these two-wheelers, with a significant increase in motorcycle use in and outside the capital in recent years.

During the last Eid-ul-Fitr, motorcycles ranked highest among vehicles involved in road crashes, according to data from the Bangladesh Jatri Kalyan Samity, a passenger welfare association. One hundred sixty-five people died and 240 sustained injuries in 198 motorcycle accidents during Eid travel, accounting for 49.62% of the total number of road accidents, 40.54% of fatalities and 30.37% of injuries during the period.

A letter dated June 5, signed by the deputy secretary of the energy division, contains instructions regarding the ""no helmet, no fuel"" directive issued by the Road Transport and Highways Division on May 20. The directive applies to motorcyclists and passengers under Section 124 of the Road Transport Act. The letter stresses that motorcycle riders and refuelling station owners must adhere to these instructions, or else legal action will be taken against them in accordance with the law.

The letter also instructs oil companies and filling station owners to take measures accordingly.

An energy division official, on condition of anonymity, said the directive was not being followed outside Dhaka, adding that the authorities were looking into the matter.

With the increasing use of motorcycles, even in rural areas, the energy division was enforcing strict measures keeping in mind the safety of the general public, the official said.

The official emphasized that people would no longer be allowed to purchase fuel if they did not use helmets.",General,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable

Unskilled drivers, over-speed, negligence of authorities concerned and rules violation are blamed for the frequent road accidents on highways, although the highway police claimed that several measures have been taken to reduce road accidents.

The recent deadly road crash on Dhaka-Khulna highway that claimed 15 lives raised questions about whether these measures were adequate to control the fatal accidents.

On April 16, 15 people including five members of a family, died in a collision between a bus and a pick-up van on Dhaka-Khulna highway at Kanaipur, Faridpur district.

A five-member probe body was formed to investigate the accident and two more members, including an expert from Buet, were also included in the committee, headed by Additional district Magistrate Ali Siddique.

The committee was asked to submit its report within three working days. At least one representative from the Roads and Highways division, Highway police, district police and Fire Service were also included in the committee.

National Committee to protect Shipping, Roads and Railways (NCPSRR) said the authorities concerned, including police and BRTA, cannot avoid responsibility for the Faridpur road crash on Dhaka-Khulna highway.

Condemning the authorities’ negligence, the NCPSRR said although carrying passengers on trucks, pick-up vans and good- laden vehicles is prohibited the vehicle was heading towards Dhaka from Faridpur’s Boalmari with 25-30 passengers on board.

On March 8, three people died and ten others were injured when a bus overturned on Dhaka-Barisal highway in Bhanga.

Besides, nine people died in separate accidents in January.

Roads and Highways division and highway police blame over-speed, unskilled drivers, reckless plying of motorbikes and pedestrians’ desperate bid to cross the highways behind the accidents and fatalities.

According to Faridpur Highway Police sources, the length of the Bangabandhu Expressway from Jatrabari in Dhaka to Bhanga in Faridpur is 55 kilometers. Of these, 32 kilometers are from Jatrabari to Padma Bridge and 23 kilometers from Janjira to Bhanga.

In the last year, 131 people were killed in 135 accidents on the expressway, and of these, 63 accidents occurred in Bhanga portion that claimed the lives of 67 people.

Ensuring road safety should never take a backseat,https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/editorial/344172/ensuring-road-safety-should-never-take-a-backseat,17-04-2024,"It is unfortunate how the Eid holidays in Bangladesh have once again highlighted the pressing issue of road safety in the country; according to a report by Dhaka Tribune, road crashes claimed the lives of 34 individuals during this period.

To say that there is an urgent need for enhanced safety measures would be an understatement, but with this spike in deaths during holidays becoming a most undesirable norm, safety measures are particularly salient during major holidays.

Bangladesh has long been struggling with a high rate of road traffic accidents, with holidays often exacerbating the situation. Factors such as reckless driving, inadequate road infrastructure, and lax enforcement of traffic laws have further compounded the risks faced by commuters as well as pedestrians during these times.

Immediate action is the need of the hour, from both the government and the public. It starts with the government truly prioritizing road safety. Investing in better infrastructure is the logical first step, including the expansion and improvement of road networks. Too often, it is our inadequate roads and highways that cause the issues.

With that said, arguably the worst offense continues to be the presence of unfit vehicles on the road combined with unfit drivers, those without licenses and proper training. It is mind boggling how, despite repeated calls to address and fix the issue, this continues to not only persist but arguably worsen with time. Stricter enforcement of traffic laws and harsh penalties for offenders are essential to deter reckless driving behaviours, and it is disheartening how we fail to ensure this time and time again.

The recent spate of road crashes during the Eid holidays serves as a stark reminder of the urgent need for enhanced road safety measures in Bangladesh. There can be no Smart Bangladesh if our people keep dying on the roads.",General,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable
